Nest (NX) Accelerator Coprocessor
---------------------------------

The NX coprocessor is present in P7+ or later processors.  Each NX node
represents a unique NX coprocessor.  The nodes are located under an
xscom node, as:

/xscom@<xscom_addr>/nx@<nx_addr>

With unique xscom and nx addresses.  Their compatible node contains
"ibm,power-nx".  There is nothing that the OS should directly do with the
NX nodes, instead the specific coprocessor nodes should be used, as
described below.


NX RNG Coprocessor
------------------

This is the Random Number Generator (RNG) coprocessor, which is a part
of each NX coprocessor.  Each node represents a unique RNG coprocessor.
The nodes are located at:

/hwrng@<addr>		: RNG at address <addr>
ibm,chip-id		: chip id where the RNG is
reg			: address of the register to read from

Each read from the RNG register will provide a new random number.


NX 842 Coprocessor
------------------

This is the memory compression coprocessor, which uses the IBM proprietary
842 compression algorithm and format.  Each node represents a unique 842
coprocessor.  The nodes are located at:

/ibm,nx842-powernv#<chip-id>	: 842 coprocessor on chip <chip-id>
ibm,chip-id			: chip id where the 842 is
ibm,coprocessor-type		: CT value common to all 842 coprocessors
ibm,coprocessor-instance	: CI value unique to all 842 coprocessors

Access to the coprocessor requires using the ICSWX instruction, which uses
a specific format including a Coprocessor Type (CT) and Coprocessor Instance (CI)
value to address each request to the right coprocessor.  The system should
use the CT and CI values for a particular node to communicate with it.  For
all 842 coprocessors in the system, the CT value will (should) be the same,
while each will have a different CI value.
