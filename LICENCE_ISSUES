- libc   : BSD licence, origin: SLOF, written by IBM
- libfdt : BSD licence, origin: dtc, written in large part by IBM
- make_offsets : origin of sed regexp unknown, I had that in picovisor,
                 it might be from older kernels, is that even copyrightable ?
                 check with ossc (it's just one big regexp)
- asm-helper macros : more/less "inspired" from Linux variants
- opal.h : OPAL API definition (copyrightable ?). Copied from Linux,
           but entirely written by IBM (myself) and had no commit or
           contribution by anybody else
