- Format of CPU Control area
- SPPACA vs. PCIA... we ask for the later and we get the former
  -> right now we support only SPPACA but we need to fix that
- Proc Init seems to be ignored
- Master LID format... we need to add ourselves there
- OPAL looks like it's using a different LID format alltogether
